## Checkboxes

### Intro

We find forms all over the web.  So you can probably imagine that working with forms can be a big part of a developer's job. JavaScript is used to listen for changes on a collection of checkboxes. Disable/enable conflicting checkboxes to ensure users can't choose more items than are allowed.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.
